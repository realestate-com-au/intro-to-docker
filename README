# An introduction to Docker

This here is material for REA's internal introductory Docker training.

The slide-deck is implemented in HTML and Javascript, so is
easy to run in any browser.  Open `index.html` to start.

If you are digesting this material as part of organised training,
we recommend running through the setup process *before* you turn
up on the day.  Specifically:

* have Docker and Docker Compose installed
* be able to successfully run `./check-docker-setup.sh`
